### Tasks

The mockup is divided into parts - the *profile widget*  at the top the *post widget*. 

1. Implement the *profile widget* **or** the *post widget* in a static web page. **It's not mandatory to implement both**.
2. Imagine a simple interaction and implement it with Javascript. For example users could...
   - toggle the follow button in the profile widget
   - or expand / collapse the post widget as shown in the picture.
3. When the implementation is finished, publish your prototype to a website and include the link to the website in your github repository.

### Implementation

I choose to implement the profile widget. The interaction can be seen when you press the "follow" button. It increment the followers count.
